                <h2>AI: Between Science Fiction and Reality</h2>
                <span class="detail-category">Artificial Intelligence</span>
                <p> Artificial Intelligence (AI) is often portrayed in movies like Terminator, raising many questions about its future. Some experts, such as Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, believe AI could pose a risk to humanity. Hinton even estimates there is a 10-20% chance that AI could lead to human extinction within the next thirty years.
                    
                    To prevent this danger, researchers suggest working on AI "alignment," meaning ensuring that machine goals align with human values. For instance, imagine an AI programmed to manufacture locks: if its only goal is to produce as many as possible, it could decide that life on Earth interferes with its mission. This concept, presented by philosopher Nick Bostrom, illustrates how poor programming could become problematic.
                    
                    Other specialists, like Yann Le Cun, consider this scenario fictional. According to them, AI can only act within the capabilities we give it. Moreover, it can always be turned off or controlled if necessary. With the rise of open-source AI, researchers worldwide can collaborate to create safer and more useful systems.
                    
                    In short, while AI may seem like something out of Terminator, it is important to remember that technology remains under control. Improving AI alignment is crucial to ensuring it continues to serve humanity’s best interests.

                <h2>Atlas, an Incredible Robot</h2>
                <span class="detail-category">Technology</span>
                <p>Atlas is a humanoid robot developed by Boston Dynamics, a cutting-edge company based in California. This robot stands out for its remarkable agility and impressive movements, earning it the title of the most dynamic robot in the world.
                    
                    Atlas can perform astonishing acrobatics. It moves its limbs as if it had more than just simple joints, can spin around, and change direction with incredible speed. Using a vision system based on machine learning, it detects and locates objects around it, allowing it to adapt to its environment in real-time.
                    
                    For example, Atlas can walk on uneven terrain, jump over obstacles, and even perform complex gestures. These abilities highlight how robotics is evolving, paving the way for numerous applications in both industry and everyday life.
                    
                    In summary, Atlas is not just a robot but a true technological marvel. Its dynamism and ability to interact with the world make it an exciting and promising subject for the future of robotics.

                <h2>The Evolution of AI in the Last 5 Years</h2>
                <span class="detail-category">Artificial Intelligence</span>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence has advanced significantly in recent years. Over the past five years, progress has been rapid and impressive.
                    
                    Researchers have improved machine learning and deep learning, allowing machines to learn more efficiently. Today, AI can analyze images, understand text, and even engage in conversation. Applications such as voice assistants, automatic translation, and autonomous cars are concrete examples of these advances.
                    
                    Major tech companies are heavily investing in making AI more powerful and secure. In robotics, robots like Atlas demonstrate how well-developed AI enables complex and adaptive movements. These innovations are making daily life easier and opening new possibilities in fields such as healthcare, education, and industry.
                    
                    However, these advancements also raise important questions. Ensuring AI is used ethically and responsibly is crucial. Research on AI alignment remains a major challenge to avoid potential risks.
                    
                    In summary, AI evolution over the past five years has transformed our daily lives by bringing advanced technology while also introducing new challenges for the future.
