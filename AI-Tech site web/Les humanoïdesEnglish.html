    Humanoids: A Threat to Humans?</h1>

    <p>
        The rapid evolution of robotics and artificial intelligence has led to the creation of increasingly advanced humanoids. These robots, which resemble humans and mimic some of their behaviors, elicit both admiration and concern. On one hand, they can be very useful in various fields like healthcare, industry, and services. On the other hand, their presence raises important questions about employment, safety, and even our relationship with machines. So, do humanoids represent a threat to humanity? Should their integration be total, or should we limit their development?
    </p>
    
    <h1>The Benefits of Humanoids</h1>

    <div class="center-image">
        <img src="https://static-images.lpnt.fr/cd-cw809/images/2015/12/11/2618003lpw-2618870-article-laboratory-jpg_3205855_660x287.jpg"class="humanoide" alt="Test">
    </div>
    
    <p>
        First, humanoids can improve our daily lives. In the medical field, they assist surgeons by making operations more precise and can also help the elderly or disabled. For example, the robot Nao is used to support children with autism and help them interact more easily. A study by the University of Tokyo shows that <B>70% of patients who interacted with therapeutic robots showed signs of improvement.</B>
In industry, these robots perform repetitive or dangerous tasks, reducing workplace accidents. According to a study by McKinsey, <B>30% of businesses using robots saw increased productivity and reduced costs.</B> Thanks to humanoids, certain tasks can be completed more quickly and with consistent precision. Their presence in logistics, product assembly, and even agriculture boosts production and reduces human errors.
Humanoids could also be beneficial in education and assisting people. Some robots can answer students' questions, adapt their teaching methods, and engage with them in interactive ways. This could improve learning and help teachers focus on more complex tasks.
    </p>
    
    <h1>A Threat to Employment and Human Relationships?</h1>

    <div class="center-image">
        <img src="https://trustmyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/travailleurs-humains-remplaces-robots-couv-1024x576.jpg.webp" class="humanoide"alt="Test">
    </div>
    
    <p>
        However, the development of humanoids raises concerns, particularly regarding employment. With automation, many jobs, especially those that require few qualifications, are at risk of disappearing. According to the World Economic Forum, <B>85 million jobs could be replaced by machines by 2025.</B> Even though new jobs will be created, it is uncertain whether everyone will be able to adapt quickly to these changes. Certain groups of workers, especially those whose skills are limited to manual tasks, risk being left behind.
Moreover, too much robot presence in our daily lives could harm human relationships. A study by the University of Oxford reveals that <B>40% of people in frequent contact with humanoids feel uneasy or anxious.</B> Some people might even become attached to robots and isolate themselves further from other humans. We may also wonder if interacting with robots capable of mimicking human emotions might partially replace real social relationships, leading to a society where human connections weaken.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Ethical and Security Risks</h1>

    <div class="center-image">
        <img src="https://media.sudouest.fr/7585995/1000x500/1955112.jpg?v=1641455612" class="humanoide"alt="Test">
    </div>

    <p>
        Another issue concerns ethics and security. Some humanoids are so lifelike that they create a strange feeling known as the "uncanny valley," where humans feel uncomfortable with robots that are too human-like but still imperfect. This could be problematic in everyday interactions, where the distinction between humans and machines becomes blurred.
Furthermore, humanoids can be vulnerable to cyberattacks. Since they are often connected to networks, they could be hacked and used for malicious purposes. A survey conducted by Kaspersky shows that <B>60% of companies with intelligent robots experienced at least one hacking attempt in 2023.</B> This means that robots programmed to perform positive tasks could be hijacked for harm. For instance, a humanoid designed to assist in a hospital could be reprogrammed to compromise patient safety.
Lastly, the use of humanoids for military purposes concerns many experts. Some countries are developing robot soldiers capable of acting autonomously on the battlefield. The International Committee of the Red Cross warns against these "lethal autonomous weapons," which could present major ethical issues. What would happen if these machines made incorrect decisions or attacked civilians? Could a robot war happen someday?
    </p>
    
    <h1>A Dependence on Technology?</h1>

    <div class="center-image">
        <img src="https://cdn.rwd.group/peoplewithenergy.co.uk/img/webp/blog/person-typing-on-laptop-9458@2x.webp"class="humanoide" alt="Test">
    </div>
    
    <p>
        The massive integration of humanoids could also make us too dependent on technology. A study by Stanford University indicates that <B>55% of young people aged 15 to 25 say they would feel "lost" without advanced artificial intelligence.</B> If we rely too much on robots for tasks, we risk losing essential skills and struggling to function without their help.
This dependence could also manifest in public services. If we become accustomed to interacting with humanoids in administration, hospitals, or stores, we could lose our ability to handle these situations autonomously. Moreover, what would happen if a massive failure affected these robots? Would we be able to return to a more traditional organization?
    </p>

    <h1>Conclusion: Finding Balance</h1>

    <div class="center-image">
        <img src="https://trustmyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ai-act-investisseurs-couv-1024x683.jpg.webp"class="humanoide" alt="Test">
    </div>

    <p>
    Humanoids can be of great help, but their presence must be regulated to avoid potential harm. It is essential to strike a balance between technological progress and the preservation of human values. On one hand, these robots could make many tasks easier and improve our daily lives, but on the other, it is crucial to monitor their impact on society, employment, and our relationships with others.
The future of humanoids will depend on the choices we make in the years to come. Should we welcome these robots into our daily lives without limits, or should we proceed cautiously with their development? The key is likely in adapting regulations and using these technologies ethically.
